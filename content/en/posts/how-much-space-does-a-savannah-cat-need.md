**How Much Space Does A Savannah Cat Need**. Food for adults is available in eight ounces every day. In fact, many savannah owners have trouble setting water bowls out for their cats, as the savannahs often prefer slapping the water out of the container instead of drinking it. Which savannah is right for you. Or it would get in the way of the cat’s play.

Mix in the wet cat food with the chicken until the adjustment period is over. The f2 generation, which has a serval grandparent and is the offspring of the f1 generation female, start from around 25% serval. In this article we will discuss the many different ways that you can feed your savannah cat. Cat users chew from 3% to 6 % of their body weight in raw food. Their average height is 16.5 inches, and their average weight is 23 pounds. Pretty much every cat loves to jump and climb, but savannahs take that desire to the next level.

### Provided that they have sufficient vertical space and exciting toys.
As a result, there are a few savannahs available for buy each year. The savannah cat is a very tall, long, and lean cat so the weight can be very misleading. That being said, how much space they will need is largely dependent on the generation and how big they get. Each subsequent generation will decrease in size but will stabilize at the third or fourth generation. Preferably your cat should be allowed the freedom of going outside, but if this isn’t practical you must provide plenty of indoor activities. However, if your savannah cat needs surgery, expect to pay around $1,500 to $3,000.
