Surreal savannahs is a small in home cattery based in alberta, canada. Much like its wild ancestor, the savannah is a tall, lean cat, with long legs, big ears, and a long neck. The first savannah cat was the result of an accidental breeding between a siamese queen owned by judee frank and a male serval that frank was watching for another breeder. When a savannah cat has traits inline with the breed standard they are of higher value as a pet or breeder. The savannah cat is a hybrid cross between an african serval and a domestic cat. Male f5 kittens generally range from about $1,000 all the way up to around $5,000 (for breeders).

### Be advised that prices are subject to change as savannah kittens mature and we are able to better evaluate their quality.
Price is based off conformation to the breed standard, temperament, demand and scarcity. An f2 is a second generation offspring with a serval grandparent, an f3 is a third generation offspring with a serval great grandparent, and so on. When researching savannahs, one will come across many unusual terms. However, there are some states, and some countries that consider it wild and therefore illegal to own. As one of the largest cat breeds, savannah cats may weigh around 25 pounds. If you want to own a real savannah cat, don’t go for the cheapest you can find.
