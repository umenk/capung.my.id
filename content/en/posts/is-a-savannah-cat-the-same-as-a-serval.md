**Is A Savannah Cat The Same As A Serval**. The savannah cat, which is the largest type of cat, is a highly coveted and exotic breed. It weighs from 20 pounds to 42 pounds and its height is up to 2 feet from the shoulders. Scientists think the smaller spots might hide those cats better among the shade of trees. This relative niche breed began gaining in popularity in the 1990s.

No two serval coats are the same. Savannah cats are bred from african servals. Along with a number of other ‘mixed’ breeds like the bengal, for instance. They are multiple breeds of savannah cat nowadays, all are almost similar, but the first generation or f1 cross has retained the large size of the serval. When a serval is bred to a serval you get serval kittens. A savannah cat is still an option for you;
