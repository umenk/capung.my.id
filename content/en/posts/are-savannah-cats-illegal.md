**Are Savannah Cats Illegal**. As previously stated, this is most likely due to the difficulties of generating f1 savannah cats. F1 savannah cats, being the most exotic generation, account for the bulk of the higher price point. It‚Äôs illegal to own an f1 savannah cat without a dangerous wild animal licence, which an average cat owner will not be able to get. In more than ten states, f1 savannah cats are prohibited.

Here is a letter i wrote to ca fish &amp; wildlife about that (with illustrations), when some petitioners using false claims tried to stealthily make savannah and bengal cats illegal in california. There is wild blood in this cat breed. It is illegal to own a serval in california without a special permit. Savannah cats may cost anywhere from $1,000 to $20,000, depending on their filial status. The savannah cat can be illegal in some places because it is a wild cat hybrid. While f1 savannah cats are not considered dangerous to humans, some us states have banned cat ownership.

### Hybrid cats consist of the breeds savannah cat (serval hybrid), bengal cat (asian leopard cat hybrid) and the jungle cat hybrid.
It is legal to own all generations of savannah cats in california. Georgia, hawaii, nebraska, and rhode island are the states where you cannot legally own a savannah cat, even without a permit. All savannah cats are illegal in georgia, hawaii, nebraska, and rhode island. Some us states consider wild cat hybrids to be similar to the wild cat themselves and all states have laws governing the possession of exotic wild cat species. However, you may have quickly discovered that it is illegal to own a savannah cat in your state. F1 savannah cats are illegal in over 10 states.
