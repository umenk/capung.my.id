**How Much Are Savannah Cats Worth**. Additional costs will be incurred after you get the cat. Compared to other cat breeds, the savannah is more loyal and social. These are a large breed cat with very long legs and easily mistaken for their big cousin the cheetah! Many breeders have tried and failed producing f1 generation savannahs.

You can generally say that a decent savannah cat will be a lot more expensive than your average moggy ! These cats are available in a variety of locations and their prices are usually determined by their breeders. Male f1 kittens generally range from about $12,000 all the way up to around $16,000. F1 savannah cats have the largest percentage of wild african serval in them, and are usually the most expensive type of savannah cat. Price is based off conformation to the breed standard, temperament, demand and scarcity. In the pet community, savannah cats are known as the most expensive felines.

### In terms of the broad average savannah cat cost, consumers can expect to pay anywhere between the price range of $1,200 and $22,000 per kitten.
Additional costs will be incurred after you get the cat. That is, if you’re willing to shell out $125,000 apiece. The f2 savannah cat usually has an average of 30% serval mix, but should still look very much like the serval breed. However, the cost of having a savannah cat is not the same as a domestic cat. First generation males and females, sometimes referred to as elite, have more than 53% serval in them, can cost anywhere from $7,000 to $23,000. So, you have learned that calico cats can be expensive depending on what sex you choose.
