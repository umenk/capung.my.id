**Savannah Cat Full Size**. What is the average size of a savannah cat? I find the claim of 33 pounds for an intact savannah to be a little hard to believe.my f6c stud boy is quite tall, very lean and actually weighs 15 pounds, although most people guess him to be around 25 lbs, lol. They’ve only been around considering that the mid 80 ′ s. The closer the generation is the serval ancestor, the larger the cat tends to be.
