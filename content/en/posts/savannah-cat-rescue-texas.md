Our goal is to continue the breeding of these wonderfully majestic animals by enhancing the qualities of the domestic cat while keeping the appearance of the african serval ancestors, we hope to be the leading breeders in central texas. Savannah rescue is a volunteer service headed up by two savannah breeders, kristine alessio and brigitte cowell, with an additional core group of volunteers. We register all our savannah cats with tica and register our ocicats and egyptian maus with cfa and tica, giving you the peace of mind that all our kittens are bred to. Texas exotic cat rescue specializes in cats who appear to have some wild heritage, such as bengalschausies, sokokes, and savannahs, including derived breeds and mixes of those, and some others such as the pixie bobs and ocicats who just look like a wild cats.
