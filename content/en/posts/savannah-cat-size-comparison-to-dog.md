**Savannah Cat Size Comparison To Dog**. A relatively young breed, the savannah cat dates to april 7, 1986, when the first kitten from the above. Size depends heavily on the generation and sex of the cat, with the f1 males just about always being the biggest. They are a bit longer than the average domestic cat, but they tend to weigh the same. Less than an f6, and you simply have a domestic shorthair cat.

The average weight of f5 female savannah cats is in the range of 10 to 12 pounds. Because of the random factors in savannah genetics, size can vary significantly, even in. The first generation of savannah cats is marked as f1 and is fifty percent serval cat and fifty percent domestic cat. The higher level of serval cat genetics will lead to a larger savannah cat. In choosing between the breeds, size is a consideration. Savannahs are tall and their body is long.

### A savannah cat tends to have a very caring and loving personality.
F1 savannah is considerably bigger, about more than twice the size, when adult than the average home cat while the first sbt bengal cat has to do with the same size as a randomly reproduced cat of typical size. When people look at a savannah cat, they typically think it is a much larger cat than it actually is due to the length and height of the cat. Subsequent generations are bred with a savannah cat father (f6 or more generations removed). The category is determined by how much serval cat is in the breed. Because of the random factors in savannah genetics, size can differ significantly, even in one litter. The first generation of savannah cats is marked as f1 and is fifty percent serval cat and fifty percent domestic cat.
