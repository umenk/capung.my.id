**F3 Savannah Cat Size**. Price is based off conformation to the breed standard, temperament, demand and scarcity. Personally, i don&#039;t find much difference between f3 and f6 (so imagine the same for f7s) in personality or size. Many people assume that the f3 females are going to be big cats. The f1 generation usually gets as large as 17 to 30 pounds.

This is not the case. The early generations, f1 and f2 are, more times than not, the biggest savannahs. Talking about their height, f6 savannah cats are 10 to 13 inches tall. Female f3 kittens typically range from about $1,000 to $4,000. For instance, the f5 savannah is usually 11 inches tall or less. The average weight of f5 female savannah cats is in the range of 10 to 12 pounds.

### Males are 14 to 20 pounds, stand approximately 14 to 17 inches at the shoulder, and are 18 to 21 inches long.
Females range from 10 to 13 pounds. Updated daily, our list of f3s is constantly changing, so check back often to find the kitten that is right for you. These cats are short as compared to f1, f2, and f3 savannah cats. The average weight of f5 female savannah cats is in the range of 10 to 12 pounds. Females range from 10 to 13 pounds. Even more hands on, theyâ€™ll want to be petted and played with often.
