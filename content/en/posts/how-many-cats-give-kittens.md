**How Many Cats Give Kittens**. The average litter size for indoor cats that have no major health problems is 3.7 to 4.5 kittens. In case you’re curious, the largest litter of kittens on record was a group of 19, born in 1970. Remember that unlike humans, cats can have kittens for the rest of their lives. Also, younger and older cats tend to have smaller litters and cats there are around 3 to 5.

Most litters have between four and eight kittens, though the size of each litter may vary from one kitten to over 10 kittens per litter. The average litter size for cats is 4 to 6 kittens; The length of stage two depends on how many kittens are present, whether this is a first pregnancy or not (first pregnancy deliveries tend to take longer), and if there are any difficulties with the birth. Most cats give birth to around four kittens, although they may have only one, or they may have more than that.

### You can expect anything between 3 and 8 kittens.
Most kittens are delivered within 12 hours; There are a lot of determinantal factors when it comes to the exact number. However, a cat usually gives birth to 3 to 9 kittens.
