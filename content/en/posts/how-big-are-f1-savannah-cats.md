**How Big Are F1 Savannah Cats**. How big is a full grown savannah cat? This is according to select exotics. They are definitely the most extreme of any of the levels due to the amount of wild serval bred into them. When a savannah cat has traits inline with the breed standard they are of higher value as a pet or breeder.

F2s are still pretty tall and stand at 16 inches. Subsequent filial generations (f4, f5, f6, etc.) are smaller in size, and tend to be more manageable as they retain less of the wild tendencies that could present behavioral challenges to pet owners. Each savannah breed is identified by its filial generation number. The savannah cat size varies according to the generation. F1 75% serval blood savannah cats also know as f1 high percentage savannah cats are the most expensive. That doesn’t mean, however, that you won’t find a large f5 or other generation.

### On average, an f1 savannah cat that is male will grow to somewhere between 17 and 25 pounds.
I would suggest that the higher end at 18 inches is an absolute maximum, i’d have thought, unless they are making them larger these days. F1 savannah cats have the largest percentage of wild african serval in their genes and they are the most expensive generation type of savannah cats. F1 males are 17 to 25 pounds, standing around 16 to 18 inches at the shoulder height and 22 to 24 inches from chest to rump level. Savannah cat f1 f2 f3 explained easily. Since domestic cats and servals crossed to create savannahs, there are now numerous subspecies of savannahs. How long until savannah cats are fully grown?
