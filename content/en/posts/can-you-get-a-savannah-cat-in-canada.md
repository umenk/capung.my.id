**Can You Get A Savannah Cat In Canada**. A serval is a cat native to the african grasslands typically found south of the sahara desert. Our kittens are sought after around the world for their vibrant coats, dramatic spots, and friendly temperaments. Savannah kittens are delivered at approximately 12 weeks of age from los cabos mexico, to ensure the kitten will be physically and emotionally ready for his or her forever home. Savannah cats are legal in every province of canada, although some provinces have restrictions on the ownership of f1 and f2 generations, and importing savannahs from the united states requires rabies vaccination and special permits.

Savannah cat breed kittens are available all yearlong. Brush your cat weekly to keep hairballs at bay, and trim your cat&#039;s nails as often as needed, which may be weekly. The coats are predominantly shades of tan or orange with black or dark brown markings. However, if there is a special savannah kitten in which you are interested, but it is not yet old enough to join your family, a deposit of half of the kitten’s cost will reserve your special kitten.
