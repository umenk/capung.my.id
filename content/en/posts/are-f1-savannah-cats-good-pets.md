Are savannah cats good pets? However, as they retain strong hunting instincts, they may pose a danger to smaller pets in the household, such as rodents, birds, and fish.

Savannahs get along, curious, smart, lively and energetic. As a result, we can enjoy a savannah that is more sociable, friendly to strangers, playful, curious and affectionate.
