**Big Domestic Cats Savannah**. The savannah was named after the habitat of the serval and its beauty echoes the lush splendor of those golden plains in africa. The savannah cat is one of the largest domestic cat breeds around. They are large and muscular with long legs and large paws. F3 males are often still considerably bigger than a domestic house cat.

Savannah cat is a hybrid of domestic cat and wild serval. The savannah cat as a hybrid of wild cat and domestic cat, can have a very variable personality. Savannah cats are a hybrid breed of domestic cats, with a genetic lineage that can be traced back to the serval, an african wildcat. Much like its wild ancestor, the savannah is a tall, lean cat, with long legs, big ears, and a long neck. It came into existence with the picture of grandeur and dignified shape of a wildcat which has its appearance similar to that of a cheetah and may resemble bengals. It is a cross between a serval and a domestic cat.

### F1 and f2 savannahs are the biggest.
Savannah cats seem to be somewhat a legendary breed of cat. Much like its wild ancestor, the savannah is a tall, lean cat, with long legs, big ears, and a long neck. Are savannah cats bigger than servals? The early generations, f1 and f2 are, more times than not, the biggest savannahs. The savannah cat is one of the largest domestic cat breeds around. These large cats are quite social and friendly with people.
