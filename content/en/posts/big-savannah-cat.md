**Big Savannah Cat**. This makes the ears of savannah cat biggest and high over the head. Sometimes, depending on your savannah’s generation, they can grow to weigh more than 20 pounds — double the size of your average house cat! Savannah cats tend to be rather large. This is still a very large frame for a cat.

The savannah cat is a hybrid cross between an african serval and a domestic cat. (for comparison, a typical domestic short. Therefore, you need to ensure you’re getting a large enough cat tree that will allow for their large height and weight. Savannah cats are tall, long and of substance (not dainty). We’d love to say that savannah cats are fantastic for all families, but the truth is, this big, active cat comes with unique needs. They are beautifully lithe and unique, and they have the appearance of a wildcat.

### Savannah cats seem to be somewhat a legendary breed of cat.
Savannah are intelligent, calm, curious and active cats that enjoy spending time in the company of humans. A savannah’s height can range from 12 to 18 inches tall. Savannah kittens are quite a handful, and adults retain their need for ample activity throughout their lifetimes. Savannah cat breed kittens are available all yearlong. Most size statistics are over exaggerated. They use the litterbox more readily and are friendly to other cats and dogs in the family.
