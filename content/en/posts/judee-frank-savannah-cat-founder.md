**Judee Frank Savannah Cat Founder**. Patrick kelley, founder of savannahcat.com and the exotic cat network. In 1989, when savannah had a litter of her own, patrick kelley purchased one of savannah’s offspring and began to champion the cause to get the new breed recognized. Bengal breeder judee frank crossbred a male serval, with a siamese domestic cat to produce the first savannah cat (named savannah) on april 7, 1986. Together, joyce sroufe, patrick kelly and lorre smith, founded the savannah cat breed.

Today’s savannah is a tall. About ten years later cat enthusiasts set out to make this hybrid cross a legitimate breed of domestic cat. Judee frank’s savannah attracted the interest of patrick kelley, who purchased one of savannah&#039;s kittens in 1989. Breeder judee frank&#039;s domestic cat gave birth to a kitten that had been sired by an african serval (african wild cat). On april 7, 1986, frank woke up to find her female siamese cat had a kitten, and quelle surprise, ernie was the father. That f1 kitten, (named savannah) was owned by suzi mutascio, as it was her serval who bred the siamese cat.

### In the early 1990s, patrick kelley, founder of savannahcat.com, enlisted joyce sroufe to help him develop the breed with kelley using offspring of that first hybrid cross.
Judee had taken charge of a small and somewhat wan serval male that owned by another breeder. Breeder judee frank&#039;s domestic cat gave birth to a kitten that had been sired by an african serval (african wild cat). Bengal breeder judee frank crossbred a male serval, belonging to suzi woods, with a siamese (domestic cat) to produce the first savannah cat (named savannah) on april 7, 1986. However, kathrin stucki a savannah cat breeder of extensive knowledge, very much doubts the existence of the uk savannah. Frank’s savannah attracted the interest of patrick kelley, who purchased one of savannah&#039;s kittens in 1989. Current owner of a1savannahs is not founder of the breed (martin stucki).
