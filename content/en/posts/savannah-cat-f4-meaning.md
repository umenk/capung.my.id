**Savannah Cat F4 Meaning**. Savannah’s have a very unique personality. Intelligent and energetic, social and outgoing, compared to a domestic cat, the f4 and f5 savannah cats are considered much more intelligent and higher energy than a domestic. Very eoutgoing, interactive and adaptable. As soon as a savannah is bred to another cat other than a savannah the offspring becomes an &#039;a&#039; again, even if one of the parents is for instance a &#039;c&#039; savannah the offspring would still be an &#039;a&#039;.

Sbt savannah cats and kittens have a greater serval percentage than say, an f4c because of the savannah to savannah breeding wth no outcrosses for at least three. The kittens from this mating carry an “a” designation, which means they are the progeny of two cats of different breeds. The f1 male generation through the f4 male generation are sterile. The savannah cat is a more manageable option that will bond with your family, as well as your other pets. Listed below are the definitions of the savannah cat registration codes. F5 savannah cats will look more like domestic cats than servals, with only about 10% and below in genes of a wild african serval.

### F plus a number seems to be the most often used and also the most confusing.
Very eoutgoing, interactive and adaptable. Offering the coveted savannah to savannah kittens. The f6 male is bred to the f1 female for f2 kittens. Shows how many generations from the serval. About 50% of the f5 males are fertile, therefore many use an f6 male for their breeding programs. Each generation is marked with a filial number.
