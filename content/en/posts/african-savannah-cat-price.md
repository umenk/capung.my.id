**African Savannah Cat Price**. Price is based off conformation to the breed standard, temperament, demand and scarcity. A savannah cat is a hybrid of an african serval and a domesticated house cat. The full purchase price for an f1 savannah cat depends on age of either sex, paperwork included. In the 1920’s, a number of american homeowners attempted to raise serval cats as pets.

All our servals and savannahs come with a license permit, pedigree, first aid kit, crate and health insurance. F1 savannah cats have the largest percentage of wild african serval in them, and are usually the most expensive type of savannah cat. This is a high price because the f1 savannah cat directly involves one serval parent. When a savannah cat has traits inline with the breed standard they are of higher value as a pet or breeder. F1 &amp; f2 generations have quite a little litter one time annually, at the time they even prolong longer time without giving birth. The average price of f2 savannah falls into the range of 15000 dollars to 20000 dollars.

### These cats can be easily trained to use a leash, play fetch and respond to other simple commands.
Savannahs are famous for their tall and sleek bodies, their large ears, long legs, and large paws. Kittens at the top end of the price range are available for breeding. The average price of f2 savannah falls into the range of 15000 dollars to 20000 dollars. As the savannah gets further away from its african heritage, the more it will resemble a domestic cat in height, weight, and appearance. However, despite its size, savannah is considered to have elegant and delicate figure. The savannah cat price ranges from $1,000 to $20,000, with a few reporting the cost going up to as much as $25,000.
