**F4 Savannah Cat Personality**. Adopt and bring home an f6 savannah kitten from our cattery. Savannah cats are a relatively new breed created toward the end of the 1990s. They were recognized as a new breed by tica in 2002 and accepted for championship status in 2012. This generation&#039;s male savannahs are considerably fertile compared to f1, f2, f3, and f4 savannah generations.

Even more hands on, theyâ€™ll want to be petted and played with often. Intelligent and energetic, social and outgoing, compared to a domestic cat, the f4 and f5 savannah cats are considered much more intelligent and higher energy than a domestic. F1 savannahs are not as affectionate and donâ€™t like to be held as much, but they are loyal and often bond with only one or two people at the most. They are quite friendly and playful and will provide countless hours of entertainment and love. Saba is f4 savannah he look just like mommy dark rich pattens, dog personality,he will bring you a lots joyðŸ˜». The personality on the f4 savannah cat is excellent.

### However, they are not any more social than the f3â€™s, yet do give some up in terms of size and look.
They do not spray very often and have a more domestic cat personality. F1s are generally large, or look large but be only 13 to 15 lbs. Most people looking for a savannah cat will purchase an f4 savannah kitten or beyond, so we will focus on those generations. Very outgoing, interactive, and adaptable. Most hardly know a stranger and will interact with anyone fairly quickly. Considering they have somewhat â€˜wildâ€™ genes, savannah cats are not the most affectionate of breeds.
