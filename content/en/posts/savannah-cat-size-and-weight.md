**Savannah Cat Size And Weight**. When people look at a savannah cat, they typically think it is a much larger cat than it actually is due to the length and height of the cat. When a savannah cat has traits inline with the breed standard they are of higher value as a pet or breeder. A savannah’s height can range from 12 to 18 inches tall. We intend to add data as time passes and also keep a history so savannah cat size may be tracked to see if generations are getting larger or smaller as time goes on.
