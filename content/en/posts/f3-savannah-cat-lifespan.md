**F3 Savannah Cat Lifespan**. You can expect to pay up to $20,000 for an f1 savannah cat and around $1500 for an f5 female. Randy is still a little savannah kitten, and as most people know, savannah f3 kittens are the only savannah generation from f1 to f5 who grow in size like normal cats. In this article we will quickly examine the life span of the domestic cat, the serval and our findings on how long savannah cats usually live. The average weight of a male f5 savannah cat is in the range of 14 to 18 pounds.

A male savannah cat with. Males are 14 to 20 pounds, stand approximately 14 to 17 inches at the shoulder, and are 18 to 21 inches long. From our personal experience with savannahs, as well as research from many of the savannah cat breeders, we have found that the general lifespan of a savannah is 17 to 20 years. The serval cats are wild that may live up to 20 years. This is due to the reported infertility of f1 to f4 male savannah cats. Wild cats live a longer life as compared to domestic cats but being a descendant of serval cats, savannah cats live a longer life.
